Hello,

Inkling recognizes that your privacy is very important and takes it seriously. As part of our growth and in support of upcoming changes to EU data protection law, we’re updating our Privacy Policy to empower you to make the best decisions about the information that you share with us.

These updates will take effect on May 25, 2018. By using our services on or after that date, you’ll be agreeing to these revisions.

Here’s a quick summary of the changes:

Improved clarity and transparency. We’ve re-organized our Privacy Policy to make it clearer and more understandable, described our data processing practices, and included examples showing how Inkling implements this Policy.

GDPR updates. The upcoming General Data Protection Regulation places new obligations on organizations that process EU personal data. As a result, we’re updating our Privacy Policy to better explain our relationship with our customers and users.

As always, thank you for using Inkling!
